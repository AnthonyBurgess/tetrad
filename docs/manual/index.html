</ul>

<h3>Creating a New Graph</h3>

<p>When you first open a graph box with no parent, you will be presented with several options for which kind of graph you would like to create: a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a structural equation model (SEM)graph, a general graph, or a time lag graph. Once you have selected the type of graph you want to create, an empty graph box will open.</p>

<p>You can add variables to your graph by clicking on the variable button on the left, then clicking inside the graph area. Add edges by clicking on an edge type, then clicking and dragging from one variable to another.  Variables may be measured (represented by rectangular icons) or latents (represented by elliptical icons). Edges may be directed, undirected, bidirected, or uncertain (represented by circles at the ends of an edge). Depending on the type of graph you choose to create, your choice of edges may be limited.</p>

<p>DAGs allow only directed, bidirected, and uncertain edges. If an edge would create a cycle (or potential cycle, in the case of uncertain edges) it will not be accepted. A graph box containing a DAG can be used as input for any parametric model box, and is the only kind of graph box that can be used as input for a Bayes parametric model.</p>

<p>SEM graphs allow only directed and bidirected edges. A graph box containing a SEM graph can be used as input to a SEM parametric model or generalized SEM parametric model, where a bidirected edge between two variables X and Y will be interpreted as X and Y having correlated error terms.
Time lag graphs allow only directed edges. New variables that you add will be initialized with a single lag. (The number of lags in the graph may be changed under “Edit—Configuration…”) Edges from later lags to earlier lags will not be accepted. Edges added within one lag will automatically be replicated in later lags.</p>

<p>The general graph option allows all edge types and configurations.</p>


<h3>Creating a Random Graph </h3>

<p>Instead of manually creating a new graph, you can randomly create one. To do so, open up a new empty graph box and click on “Graph—Random Graph.” This will open up a dialog box from which you can choose the type of random graph you would like to create by clicking through the tabs at the top of the window. Tetrad will randomly generate a DAG, a multiple indicator model (MIM) graph, or a scale-free graph. Each type of graph is associated with a number of parameters (including but not limited to the number of nodes and the maximum degree) which you can set.</p>

<p>Once a graph has been randomly generated, you can directly edit it within the same graph box by adding or removing any variables or edges that that type of graph box allows. So, for instance, although you cannot randomly generate a graph with bidirected edges, you can manually add bidirected edges to a randomly generated DAG in a SEM graph box.</p>

<p>Random graph generation is not available for time lag graphs. </p>


<h3>Loading a Saved Graph</h3>

<p>If you have previously saved a graph from Tetrad, you can load it into a new graph box by clicking “File—Load…,” and then clicking on the file type of the saved graph. Tetrad can load graphs from XML, from text, and from JSON files.</p>

<p>To save a graph to file, click “File—Save…,” then click on the file type you would like to save your graph as. Tetrad can save graphs to XML, text, JSON, and R files. (If you save your graph to R, you will not be able to load that file back into Tetrad.)</p>

<p>You can also save an image of your graph by clicking “File—Save Graph Image…” Tetrad cannot load graphs from saved image files.</p>


<h3>Copying a Graph</h3>

<p>There are two ways to copy a graph. </p>

<p>The first method allows you to copy a graph from any box which contains one. First, create a new graph box in the workspace, and draw an arrow from the box whose graph you want to copy to the new graph box. When opened, the new graph box will automatically contain a direct copy of the graph its parent box contains. </p>

<p>The second method allows you to copy a graph directly from most types of graph box. First, highlight the graph in the old graph box and click “Edit—Copy Selected Graph.” Then open up your new graph box and click “Edit—Paste Selected Graph.” (Some types of graph box do not have this functionality; see “Manipulating a Graph.”)</p>


<h3>Manipulating a Graph</h3>

<p>If you create a graph box as a child of another box, you can also choose to perform a graph manipulation on the parent graph. Your graph box will then contain the manipulated version of the parent graph.</p>

<p>The available graph manipulations are:</p>

<p>Display Subgraphs: This option allows you to isolate a subgraph from the parent graph. Add variables to the subgraph by highlighting the variable name in the “Unselected” pane and clicking on the right arrow. The hiighlighted variable will then show up in the “Selected” pane. (You may also define which variables go in the “Selected” pane by clicking on the “Text Input…” button and typing the variable names directly into the window.) Choose the type of subgraph you want to display from the drop-down panel below. Then click “Graph It!” and the resulting subgraph of the selected variables will appear in the pane on the right. (Some types of subgraph, such as “Markov Blanket,” will include unselected variables if they are part of the subgraph as defined on the selected variables. So, for instance, an unselected variable that is in the Markov blanket of a selected variable will appear in the Markov Blanket subgraph. Edges between unselected variables will not be shown.) For large or very dense graphs, it may take a long time to isolate and display subgraphs.</p>

<p>The types of subgraphs that can be displayed are:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>Subgraph (displays the selected nodes and all edges between them)</li>
<li>Adjacents (displays the selected nodes and all edges between them, as well as nodes 	adjacent to the selected nodes)</li>
<li>Adjacents of adjacents (displays the selected nodes and all edges between them, as 	well as nodes adjacent to the selected nodes and nodes adjacent to adjacencies of the 	selected nodes)</li>
<li>Adjacents of adjacents of adjacents (displays the selected nodes and all edges 	between them, as well as nodes adjacent to the selected nodes, nodes adjacent to 	adjacencies of the selected nodes, and nodes adjacent to adjacencies  of adjacencies 	of the selected nodes)</li>
<li>Markov Blankets (displays the selected nodes and all edges between them, as well 	as the Markov blankets of each selected node)</li>
<li>Treks (displays the selected nodes, with an edge between each pair if and only if a 	trek exists between them in the full graph)</li>
<li>Trek Edges (displays the selected nodes, and any treks between them, including 	nodes not in the selected set if they are part of a trek)</li>
<li>Paths (displays the selected nodes, with an edge between each pair if and only if a 	path exists between them in the full graph)</li>
<li>Path Edges (displays the selected nodes, and any paths between them, including 	nodes not in the selected set if they are part of a path)</li>
<li>Directed Paths (displays the selected nodes, with a directed edge between each pair 	if and only if a directed path exists between them in the full graph)</li>
<li>Directed Path Edges (displays the selected nodes, and any directed paths between 	them, including nodes not in the selected set if they are part of a path)</li>
<li>Y Structures (displays any Y structures involving  at least two of the selected nodes)</li>
<li>Indegree (displays the selected nodes and their parents)</li>
<li>Outdegree (displays the selected nodes and their children)</li>
<li>Degree (displays the selected nodes and their parents and children)</li>
</ul>

<p>The “Graph Properties” and “Paths” functions are available in this type of graph box, but they will display information about the full graph, not the currently displayed subgraph. To see graph properties for the subgraph, first copy it into a new graph box.</p>

<p>Choose DAG in Pattern: If given a pattern as input, this chooses a random DAG from the Markov equivalence class of the pattern to display. The resulting DAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>

<p>Choose MAG in PAG: If given a partial ancestral graph (PAG) as input, this chooses a random mixed ancestral graph (MAG) from the equivalence class of the PAG to display. The resulting MAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>

<p>Show DAGs in Pattern: If given a pattern as input, this displays all DAGs in the pattern’s Markov equivalence class. Each DAG is displayed in its own tab. Most graph box functionality is not available in this type of graph box, but the DAG currently on display can be copied by clicking “Copy Selected Graph.”</p>

<p>Generate Pattern from DAG: If given a DAG as input, this displays the pattern of the Markov equivalence class to which the parent graph belongs. The resulting pattern functions as a normal graph box.</p>

<p>Generate PAG from DAG: Converts an input graph from partial ancestral to directed acyclic format. The resulting DAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>

<p>Generate PAG from tsDAG: Converts an input graph from partial ancestral to time series DAG format. The resulting DAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>

<p>Make Bidirected Edges Undirected: Replaces all bidirected edges in the input graph with undirected edges.</p>

<p>Make Undirected Edges Bidirected: Replaces all undirected edges in the input graph with bidirected edges.</p>

<p>Make All Edges Undirected: Replaces all edges in the input graph with undirected edges.</p>

<p>Generate Complete Graph</p>

<p>Extract Structure Model</p>


<h3>Other Graph Box Functions</h3>

<p><i>Layout:</i> You can change the layout of your graph by clicking on the “Layout” tab and choosing between several common layouts. You can also rearrange the layout of one graph box to match the layout of another graph box (so long as the two graphs have identical variables) by clicking “Layout—Copy Layout” and “Layout—Paste Layout.” You do not need to a highlight the graph in order to copy the layout.</p>

<p><i>Graph Properties:</i> Clicking on “Graph—Graph Properties” will give you a text box containing the following properties of your graph:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>Number of nodes</li>
<li>Number of latent nodes</li>
<li>Number of edges</li>
<li>Number of directed edges</li>
<li>Number of bidirected edges</li>
<li>Number of undirected edges</li>
<li>Max degree</li>
<li>Max indegree</li>
<li>Max outdegree</li>
<li>Cyclicity</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Paths:</i> Clicking on “Graph—Paths” opens a dialog box that allows you to see all the paths between any two variables. You can specify whether you want to see only adjacencies, only directed paths, only semidirected paths, or all treks between the two variables of interest, and the maximum length of the paths you are interested in using drop boxes at the top of the pane. To apply those settings, click “update.”</p>

<p><i>Meek Orientation:</i> Clicking “Meek Orientation” will orient a pattern according to the Meek orientation rules.</p>

<p><i>Correlation:</i> You can automatically correlate or uncorrelated exogenous variables under the Graph tab.</p>

<p><i>Highlighting:</i> You can highlight bidirected edges, undirected edges, and latent nodes under the Graph tab.</p>




<h2 id="compare_box"><span  class="section_heading">Compare Box</span></h2>

<p>The compare box compares two or more graphs.</p>

<h3>Possible Parent Boxes of the Compare box:</h3>

<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>An estimator box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search box</li>
<li>A regression box</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible Child Boxes of the Compare box:</h3>

<ul class="ul">
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edgewise Comparisons</h3>

<p>An edgewise comparison compares two graphs, and gives a textual list of the edges which must be added to or taken away from one to make it identical to the other.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the following two graphs. The first is the reference graph, the second is the graph to be compared to it. </p>

<!-- Follow this image example to add an image -->
<img src="images/compare_box_1.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/compare_box_2.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>When these two graphs are input into the graph compare box, a window appears which allows you to specify which of the two graphs is the reference graph. When the comparison is complete, the following window results</p>

<img src="images/compare_box_3.png" alt="" width="600">


<p>When the listed changes have been made to the second graph, it will be identical to the first graph.</p>

<p>If one of the parent boxes contains multiple graphs, each graph will be compared separately to the reference graph (or the estimated graph will be compared separately to each reference graph, depending on which parent box is selected as the reference), and each comparison will be housed in its own tab, located on the left side of the window.</p>

<h3>Tabular Graph Comparisons</h3>

<p>A tabular graph comparison tallies up and presents counts of the differences and similarities between a true graph and a reference graph. Consider the example used in the above section; once again, we’ll let graph one be the true graph. Just as above, when the graphs are input to the tabular graph compare box, we must specify which of the graphs is the reference graph, and whether it contains latent variables. When the comparison is complete, the following window results:</p>

<img src="images/compare_box_4.png" alt="" width="600">


<p>The first column lists the number of adjacencies in the reference graph that are also in the true graph. The second column lists the number of adjacencies in the reference graph which are not in the compared graph. The third column lists the number of adjacencies in the comparison graph which are not in the reference graph.  The next three columns list analogous information for arrowpoints (orientations of edges).</p>

<p>If one of the parent boxes contains multiple graphs, each graph will be compared separately to the reference graph (or the estimated graph will be compared separately to each reference graph, depending on which parent box is selected as the reference), and the results listed in a separate row of the table.</p>

<h3>Misclassifications</h3>

<p>A misclassification procedure organizes a graph comparison by edge type. The edge types (undirected, directed, uncertain, partially uncertain, bidirected, and null) are listed as the rows and columns of a matrix, with the reference graph edges as the row headers and the estimate graph edges as the column headers. If, for example, there are three pairs of variables that are connected by undirected edges in the reference graph, but are connected by directed edges in the estimated graph, then there will be a 3 in the (undirected, directed) cell of the matrix. An analogous method is used to represent endpoint errors. For example:</p>

<img src="images/compare_box_5.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>If one of the parent boxes contains multiple graphs, then each estimated graph will be individually compared to the reference graph (or vice versa), and the results housed in their own tab, found on the left.</p>

<h3>Graph Intersections</h3>

<p>A graph intersection compares two or more graphs in the same comparison. It does so by ranking adjacencies (edges without regard to direction) and orientations based on how many of the graphs they appear in. In an n-graph comparison, it first lists any adjacencies found in all n graphs. Then it lists all adjacencies found in n – 1 graphs, then adjacencies found in n – 2 graphs, and so on. </p>

<p>After it has listed all adjacencies, it lists any orientations that are not contradicted among the graphs, again in descending order of how many graphs the orientation appears in. An uncontradicted orientation is one on which all graphs either agree or have no opinion. So if the edge X  Y appears in all n graphs, it will be listed first. If the edge X  Z appears in n – 1 graphs, it will be listed next, but only if the nth graph doesn’t contradict it—that is, only if the edge Z  X does not appear in the final graph. If the undirected edge Z – X appears in the final graph, the orientation X  Z is still considered to be uncontradicted.</p>

<p>Finally, any contradicted orientations (orientations that the graphs disagree on) are listed.</p>

<h3>Independence Facts Comparison</h3>

<p>Rather than comparing edges or orientation, this option directly compares the implied dependencies in two graphs. When you initially open the box, you will see the following window:</p>

<img src="images/compare_box_6.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>The drop-down menu allows you to choose which variables you want to check the dependence of. If you select more than two variables, an subsequent variables will be considered members of the conditioning set. So, if you select variables X1, X2, and X3, in that order, the box will determine whether X1 is independent of X2, conditional on X3, in each of the graphs being compared.  When you click “List,” in the bottom right of the window, the results will be displayed in the center of the window: </p>

<img src="images/compare_box_7.png" alt="" width="600">

<h3>Edge Weight Similarity Comparisons</h3>

<p>Edge weight (linear coefficient) similarity comparisons compare two linear SEM instantiated models. The output is a score equal to the sum of the squares of the differences between each corresponding edge weight in each model. Therefore, the lower the score, the more similar the two graphs are. The score has peculiarities: it does not take account of the variances of the variables, and may therefore best be used with standardized models; the complete absence of an edge is scored as 0—so a negative coefficient compares less well with a positive coefficient than does no edge at all.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, an edge weight similarity comparison between the following two SEM IMs:</p>

<img src="images/compare_box_8.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/compare_box_9.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>When they are input into an edge weight similarity comparison, the following window results: </p>


<img src="images/compare_box_10.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>This is, unsurprisingly, a high score; the input models have few adjacencies in common, let alone similar parameters.</p>

<h3>Model Fit</h3>

<p>A model fit comparison takes a simulation box and a search box (ideally, a search that has been run on the simulated data in the simulation box), and provides goodness-of-fit statistics for the output graph and the data, as well as estimating the values of any parameters. It looks and functions identically to the estimator box, but unlike the estimator box, it takes the search box directly as a parent, without needing to isolate and parameterize the graph output by the search.</p>




<h2 id="parametric_model_box"><span  class="section_heading">Parametric Model Box</span></h2>

<p>The parametric model box takes a nonparameterized input graph and creates a causal model.</p>

<h3>Possible Parent Boxes of the Parametric Model Box:</h3>

<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>Another  parametric model box</li>
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>An estimator box</li>
<li>A data box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search box</li>
<li>A regression box</li>
</ul>


<h3>Possible Child Boxes of the Parametric Model Box:</h3>

<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>Another  parametric model box</li>
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>An estimator box</li>
<li>A data box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search box</li>
<li>A knowledge box</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bayes Parametric Models</h3>

<p>A Bayes parametric model takes as input a DAG. Bayes PMs represent causal structures in which all of the variables are categorical.</p>

<p>Bayes PMs consist of three components: the graphical representation of the causal structure of the model; for each named variable, the number of categories which that variable can assume; and the names of the categories associated with each variable.</p>

<p>You may either manually assign categories to the variables or have Tetrad assign them at random. If you choose to manually create a Bayes PM, each variable will initially be assigned two categories, named numerically. If you choose to have Tetrad assign the categories, you can specify a minimum and maximum number of categories possible for any given variable. You can then manually edit the number of categories and category names.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the following DAG:</p>

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_1.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>One possible random Bayes PM that Tetrad might generate from the above DAG, using the default settings, looks like this:</p>

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_2.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>To view the number and names of the categories associated with each variable, you can click on that variable in the graph, or choose it from the drop-down menu on the right. In this graph, X1 and X2 each have three categories, and the rest of the variables have four categories. The categories are named numerically by default.</p>

<p>The number of categories associated with a particular variable can be changed by clicking up or down in the drop-down menu on the right. Names of categories can be changed by overwriting the text already present.</p>

<p>Additionally, several commonly-used preset variable names are provided under the “Presets” tab on the right. If you choose one of these configurations, the number of categories associated with the current variable will automatically be changed to agree with the configuration you have chosen. If you want all of the categories associated with a variable to have the same name with a number appended (e.g., x1, x2, x3), choose the “x1, x2, x3…” option under Presets.</p>

<p>You can also copy category names between variables in the same Bayes PM by clicking on “Transfer—Copy categories” and “Transfer—Paste categories.”</p>

<h3>SEM Parametric Models</h3>

<p>The parametric model of a structural equation model (SEM) will take any type of graph as input, as long as the graph contains only directed and bidirected edges. SEM PMs represent causal structures in which all variables are continuous. </p>

<p>A SEM PM has two components: the graphical causal structure of the model, and a list of parameters used in a set of linear equations that define the causal relationships int the model. Each variable in a SEM PM is a linear function of a subset of the other variables and of an error term drawn from a Normal distribution.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a SEM graph and the SEM PM that Tetrad creates from it:</p>

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_3.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_4.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>You can see the error terms in the model by clicking “Parameters—Show Error Terms.” In a SEM model, a bidirected edge indicates that error terms are correlated, so when error terms are visible, the edge between X1 and X2 will instead run between their error terms.</p>

<p>To change a parameter’s name or starting value for estimation, double click on the parameter in the window.</p>

<h3>Generalized SEM Parametric Models</h3>

<p>A generalized SEM parametric model takes as input any type of graph, as long as the graph contains only directed edges. (The generalized SEM PM cannot currently interpret bidirected edges.) Like a SEM PM, it represents causal structures in which all variables are continuous. Also like a SEM PM, a generalized SEM PM contains two components: the graphical causal structure of the model, and a set of equations representing the causal structure of the model. Each variable in a generalized SEM PM is a function of a subset of the other variables and an error term. By default, the functions are linear and the error terms are drawn from a Normal distribution (as in a SEM PM), but the purpose of a generalized SEM PM is to allow editing of these features.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a general graph and the default generalized SEM PM Tetrad creates using it:</p>

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_5.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_6.png" alt="" width="600">


<p>You can view the error terms by clicking “Tools: Show Error Terms.”

<p>The Variables tab contains a list of the variables and the expressions that define them, and a list of the error terms and the distributions from which their values will be drawn. Values will be drawn independently for each case if the model is instantiated (see IM box) and used to simulate data (see data box).</p>

<p>The Parameters tab contains a list of the parameters and the distributions from which they are drawn. When the model in instantiated in the IM box, a fixed value of each parameter will be selected according to the specified distribution. </p>

<p>To edit an expression or parameter, double click on it (in any tab). This will open up a window allowing you to change the function that defines the variable or distribution of the parameter.</p> 

<p>For instance, if you double click on the expression next to X1 (b1*X5+E_X1), the following window opens:</p>

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_7.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>The drop-down menu at the top of the window lists valid operators and functions. You could, for example, change the expression from linear to quadratic by replacing b1*X5+E_X1 with b1*X5^2+E_X1. You can also form more complicated expressions, using, for instance, exponential or sine functions. If the expression you type is well-formed, it will appear in black text; if it is invalid, it will appear in red text. Tetrad will not accept any invalid changes. </p> 

<p>Parameters are edited in the same way as expressions.</p> 

<p>If you want several expressions or parameters to follow the same non-linear model, you may wish to use the Apply Templates tool. This allows you to edit the expressions or parameters associated with several variables at the same time. To use the Apply Templates tool, click “Tools: Apply Templates….”  This will open the following window:</p> 

<img src="images/parametric_model_box_8.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>You can choose to edit variables, error terms, or parameters by clicking through the “apply to” radio buttons.  If you type a letter or expression into the “starts with” box, the template you create will apply only to variables, error terms, or parameters which begin with that letter for expression. For example, in the given generalized PM, there are two types of parameters: the standard deviations s1-s6 and the edge weights b1-b7. If you click on the “Parameters” radio button and type “b” into the “Starts with” box, only parameters b1-b7 will be affected by the changes you make.</p> 

<p>The “Type Template” box itself works in the same way that the “Type Expression” box works in the “Edit Expression” window, with a few additions. If you scroll through the drop-down menu at the top of the window, you will see the options NEW, TSUM, and TPROD. Adding NEW to a template creates a new parameter for every variable the template is applied to. TSUM means “sum of the values of this variable’s parents,” and TPROD means “product of the values of this variable’s parents.” The contents of the parentheses following TSUM and TPROD indicate any operations which should be performed upon each variable in the sum or product, with the dollar sign ($) functioning as a wild card. For example, in the image above, TSUM(NEW(b)*$) means that, for each parent variable of the variable in question, a new “b” will be created and multiplied by the parent variable’s value, and then all of the products will be added together.</p>

<p>A Bayes IM consists of a Bayes parametric model with defined probability values for all variables. This means that, conditional on the values of each of its parent variables, there is a defined probability that a variable will take on each of its possible values. For each assignment of a value to each of the parents of a variable X, the probabilities of the several values of X must sum to 1.</p>

<p>You can manually set the probability values for each variable, or have Tetrad assign them randomly. If you choose to have Tetrad assign probability values, you can manually edit them later. If you wish for Tetrad to randomly reassign probability values each time the box is opened, check “Pick new random values every time this Bayes IM is re-initialized.” then if you destroy the model in the box and create a new one, the box will remember the random values it created.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a Bayes PM and its randomly created instantiated model:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_1.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_2.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>In the model above, when X4 and X5 are both 0, the probability that X5 is 0 is 0.0346, that X5 is 1 is 0.4425, and that X5 is 2 is 0.5229. Since X5 must be 0, 1, or 2, those three values must add up to one, as must the values in every row.</p>

<p>To view the probability values of a variable, either double click on the variable in the graph or choose it from the drop-down menu on the right. You can manually set a given probability value by overwriting the text box. Be warned that changing the value in one cell will delete the values in all of the other cells in the row.  Since the values in any row must sum to one, if all of the cells in a row but one are set, Tetrad will automatically change the value in the last cell to make the sum correct. For instance, in the above model, if you change the first row such that the probability that X5 = 0 is 0.5000 and the probability that X5 = 1 is 0.4000, the probability that X5 = 2 will automatically be set to 0.1000.</p>

<p>If you right click on a cell in the table (or two-finger click on Macs), you can choose to randomize the probabilities in the row containing that cell, randomize the values in all incomplete rows in the table, randomize the entire table, or randomize the table of every variable in the model. You can also choose to clear the row or table.</p>


<h3>Bayes Instantiated Models: Observed Variables Only</h3>

<p>This box functions in the same way as a Bayes IM box, but represents only measured variables in the model.</p>

<h3>Dirichlet Instantiated Models</h3>

<p>A Dirichlet instantiated model is a specialized form of a Bayes instantiated model. Like a Bayes IM, a Dirichlet IM consists of a Bayes parametric model with defined probability values. Unlike a Bayes IM, these probability values are not manually set or assigned randomly. Instead, the pseudocount is manually set or assigned uniformly, and the probability values are derived from it.  The pseudocount of a given value of a variable is the number of data points for which the variable takes on that value, conditional on the values of the variable’s parents, where these numbers are permitted to take on non-negative real values. Since we are creating models without data, we can set the pseudocount to be any number we want. If you choose to create a Dirichlet IM, a window will open allowing you to either manually set the pseudocounts, or have Tetrad set all the pseudocounts in the model to one number, which you specify.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a Bayes PM and the Dirichlet IM which Tetrad creates from it when all pseudocounts are set to one:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_3.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_4.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>In the above model, when X2=0 and X6=0, there is one (pseudo) data point at which X4=0, one at which X4=1, and one at which X4=2. There are three total (pseudo) data points in which X2=0 and X6=0. You can view the pseudocounts of any variable by clicking on it in the graph or choosing it from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. To edit the value of a pseudocount, double click on it and overwrite it. The total count of a row cannot be directly edited.</p>

<p>From the pseudocounts, Tetrad determines the conditional probability of a category. This estimation is done by taking the pseudocount of a category and dividing it by the total count for its row. For instance, the total count of X4 when X2=0 and X6=0 is 3. So the conditional probability of X4=0 given that X2=0 and X6=0 is 1/3. The reasoning behind this is clear: in a third of the data points in which X2 and X6 are both 0, X4 is also 0, so the probability that X4=0 given that X2 and X6 also equal 0 is probably one third.  This also guarantees that the conditional probabilities for any configuration of parent variables add up to one, which is necessary.</p>

<p>To view the table of conditional probabilities for a variable, click the Probabilities tab. In the above model, the Probabilities tab looks like this: </p>

<h3>SEM Instantiated Models</h3>

<p>A SEM instantiated model is a SEM parametric model in which the parameters and error terms have defined values.  If you choose to create a SEM IM, the following window will open:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_6.png" alt="" width="600">


<p>Using this box, you can specify the ranges of values from which you want coefficients, covariances, and variances to be drawn for the parameters in the model. In the above box, for example, all linear coefficients will be between -1.5 and -0.5 or 0.5 and 1.5. If you uncheck “symmetric about zero,” they will only be between 0.5 and 1.5.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a SEM PM and a SEM IM generated from it using the default settings: </p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_7.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_8.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>You can now manually edit the values of parameters in one of two ways.  Double clicking on the parameter in the graph will open up a small text box for you to overwrite. Or you can click on the Tabular Editor tab, which will show all of the parameters in a table which you can edit.  The Tabular Editor tab of our SEM IM looks like this:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_9.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>In the Tabular Editor tab of a SEM estimator box (which functions similarly to the SEM IM box), the SE, T, and P columns provide statistics showing how robust the estimation of each parameter is. Our SEM IM, however, is in an instantiated model box, so these columns are empty.</p>

<p>The Implied Matrices tab shows matrices of relationships between variables in the model. In the Implied Matrices tab, you can view the covariance or correlation matrix for all variables (including latents) or just measured variables. In our SEM IM, the Implied Matrices tab looks like this:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_10.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>You can choose the matrix you wish to view from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. Only half of any matrix is shown, because in a well-formed acyclic model, the matrices should be symmetric.  The cells in the Implied Matrices tab cannot be edited.</p>

<p>In an estimator box, the Model Statistics tab provides goodness of fit statistics for the SEM IM which has been estimated. Our SEM IM, however, is in an instantiated model box, so no estimation has occurred, and the Model Statistics tab is empty.</p>


<h3>Standardized SEM Instantiated Models </h3>

<p>A standardized SEM instantiated model consists of a SEM parametric model with defined values for its parameters.  In a standardized SEM IM, each variable (not error terms) has a Normal distribution with 0 mean and unit variance. The input PM to a standardized SEM IM must be acyclic.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an acyclic SEM PM and the standardized SEM IM which Tetrad creates from it</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_11.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_12.png" alt="" width="600">


<p>To edit a parameter, double click on it. A slider will open at the bottom of the window (shown above for the edge parameter between X1 and X2). Click and drag the slider to change the value of the parameter, or enter the specific value you wish into the box. The value must stay within a certain range in order for the Normal distribution to stay standardized, so if you attempt to overwrite the text box on the bottom right with a value outside the listed range, Tetrad will not allow it. In a standardized SEM IM, error terms are not considered parameters and cannot be edited, but you can view them by clicking Parameters: Show Error Terms. </p>

<p>The Implied Matrices tab works in the same way that it does in a normal SEM IM.</p>


<h3>Generalized SEM Instantiated Models</h3>

<p>A generalized SEM instantiated model consists of a a generalized SEM parametric model with defined values for its parameters. Since the distributions of the parameters were specified in the SEM PM, Tetrad does not give you the option of specifying these before it creates the instantiated model.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a generalized SEM PM and its generalized SEM IM:</p>

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_13.png" alt="" width="600">

<img src="images/instantiated_model_box_14.png" alt="" width="600">

<p>Note that the expressions for X6 and X2 are not shown, having been replaced with the words “long formula.” Formulae over a certain length—the default setting is 25 characters—are hidden to improve visibility. Long formulae can be viewed in the Variables tab, which lists all variables and their formulae. You can change the cutoff point for long formulae by clicking Tools: Formula Cutoff.</p>

<p>If you double click on a formula in either the graph or the Variables tab, you can change the value of the parameters in that formula. </p>

<h3>The FGES Algorithm</h3>

<p>
Description: FGES is an optimized and parallelized version of an algorithm developed by Meek
[Meek, 1997] called the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). The algorithm was further developed
and studied by Chickering [Chickering, 2002]. GES is a Bayesian algorithm that heuristically
searches the space of CBNs and returns the model with highest Bayesian score it finds. In
particular, GES starts its search with the empty graph. It then performs a forward stepping search in
which edges are added between nodes in order to increase the Bayesian score. This process
continues until no single edge addition increases the score. Finally, it performs a backward
stepping search that removes edges until no single edge removal can increase the score. For more
information see http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/pdfs/fgesc.pdf. The reference is Ramsey et al., 2017.
</p>

<p>
The algorithms requires a decomposable score—that is, a score that for the entire DAG model is a
sum of logged scores of each variables given its parents in the model. The algorithms can take all
continuous data (using the SEM BIC score), all discrete data (using the BDeu score) or a mixture
of continuous and discrete data (using the Conditional Gaussian score); these are all decomposable
scores.
</p>

<p>
Input Assumptions: Data that’s all continuous, all discrete, or a mixture of continuous and discrete
variables. Continuous variables will be assumed to be linearly associated; discrete variable will be
assumed to be associated by multinomial conditional probability tables. Continuous variables for
the mixed case will be assumed to be jointly Gaussian.
</p>

<P> 
Output Format: A pattern, same as PC.

<thead>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sample prior</td>
<td> For the BDeu score (discrete variables), this is the effective sample
size added to each conditional probability table. Must be at least 1 (blame the 
90
Dirichlet distribution). Default 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Structure prior</td>
<td> For the BDeu score (discrete variables), this is the number of
variables one expects to see on average in any particular conditional probability
table. If one expects to see for the most part conditional models of variables with
two parents, then this should be set to 2. Default 1.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Penalty discount</td>
<td>  For the SEM BIC score (continuous variables), BIC is calculated
as BIC = 2 L – c k ln n, where L is the likelihood, k is the number of degrees of
freedom, n is the sample size, and c (the “penalty discount” is some positive
constant, usual greater than or equal to 1. Setting this to a larger number makes the
output of FGES sparser. Default 2.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yes if the first step of FGES should do scoring for both X->Y and Y->X</td>
<td> For the
linear, Gaussian case, and for the multinomial case, the scores for these two
directions are guaranteed to be equal, but in some domains, like mixed variables
search, they are not, and the best score of the two should be used. Default false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yes if (one edge) faithfulness should be assumed</td>
<td>The algorithm will remove edges
X—Y in the initial step if X and Y are uncorrelated; this speeds up the algorithm
(See Maathuis, ??, Ramsey et al., ??). However, this may remove edges that the
original GES algorithm would not remove, so an additional pass through the
algorithm may need to be done to pick up these additional edges and guarantee
correctness. This should be set to Yes if the additional pass should not be done, No
if the additional pass should be done. Default false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The maximum degree of the graph</td>
<td> For some graphs, FGES may be inclined to find
many adjacents for particular nodes, and in the forward step it will add adjacents
that will later be removed in the backward step. To keep such edges from being
added, one may specify a maximum degree for the graph. In the forward step, fGES
will not add edges that results in the degree of any node exceeding this maximum.
Default 100.</td>
