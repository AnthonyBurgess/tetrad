This is the code for the Tetrad project. Please, if you are a user of Tetrad, or even 
a novice, if you are willing, would you please consider giving us feedback on what you 
like about it or don't like about it? It would be most appreciated. Just open up an 
issue (click on the Issues tab, above).

We have recently developed Tetrad in conjunction with a grant; the website for that
graph is here:

For instructions on how to set this project up in 
IntelliJ IDEA, see the Wiki. Alternatively, you can 
run the lifecycle package target and launch the ejar 
that is  built in the target directory, using the call

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where g is the number of gigabytes allocated for heap.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these 
packages:

tetrad
pitt
tetradapp (now succeeded by Causal Command - https://github.com/bd2kccd/causal-cmd)

The  tetrad-lib package contains the "model" code; the 
tetrad-gui package contains the "view" (GUI) code.
