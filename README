would you please consider giving us feedback on what you like about it or 
don't like about it? It would be most appreciated. Just open up an issue 
(click on the Issues tab, above).

Alternatively, you can run the lifecycle package target and launch the ejar that is  
built in the target directory, using the call

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where g is the number of gigabytes allocated for heap.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these packages:

tetrad
pitt
tetradapp

For the command line version, see causal Command:

https://github.com/bd2kccd/causal-cmd

The  tetrad-lib package contains the "model" code; the 
tetrad-gui package contains the "view" (GUI) code.
