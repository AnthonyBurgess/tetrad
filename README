NEWS: 7.1.3-1 RELEASED 2023-01-18:

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases/tag/v7.1.3-1
https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/github/cmu-phil/tetrad-gui/7.1.3-1/

The purpose of Tetrad is to make algorithms available to do causal inference. The Dietrich College (Carnegie Mellon University) web page for Tetrad is here: 

https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2020/august/tetrad-sail.html

The jar to launch the Tetrad GUI is here (please download this one and delete any old ones):

https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/github/cmu-phil/tetrad-gui/7.1.3-1/tetrad-gui-7.1.3-1-launch.jar

The application will work on all major platforms once a recent version of the Java JRE is installed. (Corretto 18 is fine, for instance.) You may be able to launch it by double clicking the jar file name, though on a Mac, this presents some security challenges--

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Dealing-with-Tetrad-on-a-Mac--security-issues

On all platforms, the jar may be launched at the command line (with a specification of the amount of RAM you will allow it to use) using this command:

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where 'g' is the maximum number of Gigabytes you wish to allocate to the process. Launching Tetrad in this way will avoid said security issues on a Mac.

The link to the causal-cmd repository for Tetrad (which allows Tetrad algorithms to be run at the command line) is here:

All artifacts for Tetrad and causal-cmd are published in Maven Central, here:

Javadocs and source code for each release are included in the Maven Central publication for that release.

For instructions on how to set this project up in IntelliJ IDEA, see:

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Tetrad-in-IntelliJ-IDEA

Alternatively, you can run the lifecycle package target and launch the "-launch" jar that is  
built in the target directory.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these packages:

tetrad
pitt
tetradapp

The  tetrad-lib package contains the "model" code; the tetrad-gui package contains the "view" (GUI) code.
