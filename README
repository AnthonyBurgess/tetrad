https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases/tag/v7.1.3-1
https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/github/cmu-phil/tetrad-gui/7.1.3-1/

The purpose of Tetrad is to make algorithms available to do causal inference. The Dietrich College (Carnegie Mellon University) web page for Tetrad is here: 

https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2020/august/tetrad-sail.html

The jar to launch the Tetrad GUI is here (please download this one and delete any old ones):

https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/github/cmu-phil/tetrad-gui/7.1.3-1/tetrad-gui-7.1.3-1-launch.jar

The application will work on all major platforms once a recent version of the Java JRE is installed, (Corretto 18 is fine, for instance.) On most platforms you will be able to launch it by double clicking the jar file. On a Mac, after an attempt to launch it, you will need to go to the Security and Privacy control panel under System Settings in the Apple menu) and verify taht you wish to open the application.

The jar may also be launched at the command line (with a specifiation of the amount of RAM you will allow it to use) using this command:

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where 'g' is the maximum number of Gigabytes you wish to allocate to the process.

Javadocs can be found by running the javadocs command on the project once checked out.

For instructions on how to set this project up in IntelliJ IDEA, see:

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Tetrad-in-IntelliJ-IDEA

Alternatively, you can run the lifecycle package target and launch the ejar that is  
built in the target directory, using the call

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where g is the number of gigabytes allocated for heap.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these packages:

tetrad
pitt
tetradapp

For the command line version, see causal Command:

https://github.com/bd2kccd/causal-cmd

The  tetrad-lib package contains the "model" code; the 
tetrad-gui package contains the "view" (GUI) code.
