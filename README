For instructions on how to set this project up in IntelliJ IDEA, see:

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Tetrad-in-IntelliJ-IDEA

Alternatively, you can run the lifecycle package target and launch the ejar that is  
built in the target directory, using the call

java -Xmx[g]G -jar *-launch.jar

where g is the number of gigabytes allocated for heap.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these packages:

tetrad
pitt
tetradapp

For the command line version, see causal Command:

https://github.com/bd2kccd/causal-cmd

The  tetrad-lib package contains the "model" code; the 
tetrad-gui package contains the "view" (GUI) code.
