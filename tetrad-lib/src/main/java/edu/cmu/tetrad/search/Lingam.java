 * A linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for causal discovery. Journal of Machine Learning
 * Research, 7(10).</p>
 *
 * <p>The focus for this implementation was making super-simple code, not so much
 * because the method was trivial (it's not) but out of an attempt to compartmentalize.
 * Bootstrapping and other forms of improving the estimate of BHat were not addressed,
 * and no attempt was made here to ensure that LiNGAM outputs a DAG. Fpr acuyclic inputs,
 * it does tend to. Also, no attempt was made to implement DirectLiNGAM since it was tangential
 * to the effort to get LiNG-D to work. Also, only a passing effort to get either of these
 * algorithms to handle real data. There are one tuning parameters (in addition to the FastICA
 * paramters that are exposed)--a threshold on the B matrix for finding edges in the final
 * graph. A future version may use bootstrapping with a p-value; this has not been addressed
 * here.</p>
 *
 * <p>We are using the Hungarian Algorithm to fine best diagonal for the W matrix.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is not configured to respect knowledge of forbidden and required
 * edges.</p>
