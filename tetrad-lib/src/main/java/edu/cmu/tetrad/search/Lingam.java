 * <p>Implements an interpretation of the LiNGAM algorithm. The reference is here:</p>
 *
 * <p>Shimizu, S., Hoyer, P. O., Hyv√§rinen, A., Kerminen, A., &amp; Jordan, M. (2006).
 * A linear non-Gaussian acyclic model for causal discovery. Journal of Machine Learning
 * Research, 7(10).</p>
 *
 * <p>The focus for this implementation was making super-simple code, not so much
 * because the method was trivial (it's not) but out of an attempt to compartmentalize.
 * Bootstrapping and other forms of improving the estimate of B Hat were not addressed.
 * A parameter is included to set whether an acyclic model is to be enforced; it this
 * is set to true, then as in the above reference small coefficients are set to zero
 * until an acyclic model is achieved. Even without this fpr acyclic inputs, in our
 * esperience, it does tend to produce an acyclic model in simulation, though for cyclic
 * inputs it tends to produce the cyclic DAG, so long as coefficients are bounded somewhat
 * away from zero. No attempt was made to implement DirectLiNGAM since it was tangential
 * to the effort to get LiNG-D to work. Only a passing effort was made to ensure good
 * performance on real data. There is an additional tuning parameters (in addition to the
 * FastICA paramters that are exposed), a threshold on the absolute value of entries in the
 * B Hat matrix for finding edges in the final graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>We are using the Hungarian Algorithm to find the best diagonal for the W matrix
 * and are not doing any searches over all permutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is not configured to respect knowledge of forbidden and required
 * edges.</p>
